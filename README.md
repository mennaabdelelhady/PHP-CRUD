## Features
- **Create**: Add new records to the database via a form.
- **Read**: Display all records in a structured table.
- **Update**: Edit and update existing records.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher
- **MySQL**: Version 5.7 or higher
- **XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP**: A local development environment
- **Web Browser**: Any modern browser

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mennaabdelelhady/PHP-CRUD.git
   ```
2. **Set Up the Database**:
   Open your MySQL management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
   Create a new database called php_crud.
   Import the SQL file provided in the repository (if included) or create the table manually:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE records (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
   );
   ```
3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   Update the database connection settings in the db.php file:
   ```php
   <?php
   $conn = new mysqli('localhost', 'root', '', 'php_crud');
   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   ?>
   ```
4. **Run the Project**:
   Place the project folder in your local server's root directory (htdocs for XAMPP).
   Start Apache and MySQL using your local server control panel.
   Open your browser and go to http://localhost/PHP-CRUD.
